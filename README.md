<h1 align="center">The Perfect E-Commerce Store ✨🛒 !</h1>

This is one of the most complicated projects I've done to date, and I'm quite proud of it. It has endless functionalities from the simple adding new products, to proceeding, and successfully handling payments using Stripe.

As with my previous ones, this one is also using the MERN stack. MongoDB as a database, and with a seamless integration and caching in Redis. Robust and very secure authentifcation system, JWT with Refresh and Access Tokens. Product management, shopping cart functionality, coupon code system, sales analystics, security, data protection, user signup/login, and a perfect Admin Dashboard for those responsible of managing the digital store.
